 * `/` commands in a composer: spotting the one being typed, keeping the

 * The `@` picker's sibling, but a much smaller thing. Nothing is attached and
 * nothing is resolved — picking a command only writes text, because Claude
 * Code's own CLI expands `/name args` when the message reaches it. Neither
 * this file nor the server has to know a command was used.
 *
 * The list comes from the SDK (`supportedCommands()`), keyed by folder, and is
 * small enough — a few dozen entries — that the search is local and instant.
 * No debounce: the list is already here, so narrowing it is a filter, not a
 * fetch.
