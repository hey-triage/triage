/**
 * The lit pill behind a recognized `/command` in the prompt box.
 *
 * A textarea can't style part of its own value, and mirroring the whole draft
 * to fake it is the usual answer — but it isn't needed here, because a command
 * is only ever the first token of the first line. So this measures one
 * substring and parks a rectangle at the box's text origin, with no wrapping
 * to mirror and no selection to keep in step.
 *
 * It lights only for a name that *resolves*: `/release` gets the pill,
 * `/relase` gets nothing. That absence is the whole point — it is how the box
 * says "this will reach the model as prose" without an error state flashing at
 * every half-typed name on the way there.
