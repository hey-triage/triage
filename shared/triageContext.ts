/**
 * What triage tells a model about itself — the one place the product explains
 * its own vocabulary, split by how often each layer changes:
 *
 *   static concepts  → `TRIAGE_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS`, the MCP server's `instructions`
 *                      block. Identical for every session and every workspace,
 *                      so it caches; carried on both transports (the in-process
 *                      server in server/index.ts and the stdio shim in
 *                      server/mcp.ts) because both expose the same tools.
 *   session identity → `triageSessionAppend()`, appended to Claude Code's own
 *                      system prompt at spawn so it survives `resume`. Workspace,
 *                      session id, artifacts folder — known at spawn, fixed for
 *                      the session's life.
 *   live state       → neither. Which items are open and which artifacts exist
 *                      is a tool call away and stale a turn later; putting it in
 *                      a prompt re-bills it every turn to say something wrong.
 *
 * Dependency-free on purpose: the stdio shim imports only `node:readline` and
 * this file, so it stays a shim.

export const TRIAGE_MCP_INSTRUCTIONS = `Triage is a local work inbox for one engineer. It ranks what actually needs them — GitHub, Slack, Linear, and their own to-dos — and runs one loop: identify → brief → dispatch. These tools are that inbox. Everything is on this machine; nothing here posts anywhere.

- work item — one piece of work, id-keyed: "github:owner/repo#12", "slack:…", "linear:KEY-1", "manual:<uuid>". Scanned items are upserted by their scanner and update-only-if-newer, so only "manual:" items can be edited here. Status is open, snoozed, done or archived; list_work_items shows open ones by default, get_work_item reads any of them.
- artifact — a markdown file in the workspace's artifacts folder, committed to git on every write. Its author is "human" or "model": you may rewrite artifacts you wrote, and human-authored ones are refused to you — read them, cite them, propose changes in the chat, never overwrite them.
- link — an artifact or a session attached to a work item, with a role. "brief" is the single research document about an item; "context" is a note to read alongside it; "dispatch" is the session doing the work. Attach a note with write_artifact's \`links\`, or link_artifact after the fact.
- brief — a model-written artifact about one item, produced by a headless run against a playbook. Read the brief before starting work on an item.
- playbook / dispatch template — the user's own prose for how a kind of item gets briefed and how its session opens. User-owned files; not yours to rewrite.

list_work_items, get_work_item, get_session_context, list_artifacts and read_artifact are free reads — use them rather than guessing. Every other tool writes, and the user is asked first.`

Nothing about the current state of the inbox is in this prompt, because it would be out of date by the time
you read it. Look it up instead: get_session_context with this session's id says which work item this session
was opened for and which artifacts are attached to it; get_work_item follows any item id, at any status.`

too when there is one, so the note comes back with the work rather than getting lost in the transcript.`
