/**
 * Inbox assembly (.docs/watches-v2.md). Under the durable model every source —
 * GitHub, Slack watch hits, manual to-dos — is already a row in the work-item
 * store; nothing is fetched here and there is no user-state overlay (status
 * lives on the row). This is a pure fold: take the items for a status, score
 * them deterministically, and link cross-source refs into one card. No LLM, no
 * I/O — the server does ingestion and reconciliation before calling this.
