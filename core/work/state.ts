/**
 * Item lifecycle (.docs/watches-v2.md). A work item is a durable fact: once
 * created it is never hard-deleted and never silently removed. It moves between
 * four states only via recorded transitions, and every transition is appended
 * to a per-item event log — the item's `status` is just a materialization of
 * the latest event. Current state is always derivable from the log; any
 * mismatch is a visible bug.
 *
 * The LLM decides relevance, never lifecycle: existence, reopen, and expiry are
 * deterministic code operating on ingestion/source timestamps, applied here and
 * in the store adapter, never inferred from model output.
